# TransacTrade Code Test for Salt Lending

In this application I've used node.js, express, mongoose, keystonejs, jQuery, and Materialize CSS.  I hope you enjoy the work I've done, and look forward to hearing back from you soon.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run the application, you will need a running MongoDB instance with a collection named "transactrade" (without the quotes, of course), node (and npm), and depending on OS a configured C/C++ compiler.

### Installing

Unpack the archive (you already did that, don't panic) and, if using npm, run:

```
npm install
```

Or, if you're using yarn...  Do that.

```
yarn install
```


### Configuration

You must first configure the .env file before running the server, please use the included .env.example as reference.
Be sure to verify the database host and collection before running the server.


### Starting the Application
To start the server, run:
```
npm start
```
or
```
yarn start
```
